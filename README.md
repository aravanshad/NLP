### 

This goal of this repository is to provide resources to learn and practice NLP. 

This is a summarized version of tutorial by [Harrison Kinsley](https://pythonprogramming.net/tokenizing-words-sentences-nltk-tutorial/) on Natural Language Processing. I think this tutorial is good to start learning NLP.
I will update these files occasionally by adding more example codes. 

### Install 

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains most of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Tutorials` folder.  

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Tutorials/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
